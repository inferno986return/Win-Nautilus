//This ReadMe is a work in progress!

This is Win-Nautilus, a port of the official navigational file manager from the GNOME desktop to Microsoft Windows XP/Vista/7/8.

This project's aim is to port the vanilla Nautilus file manager to Microsoft Windows,complete with all the features GNOME users
love but with the interface design, GUI widgets and iconography that the Windows platform provides 
(we promise there will be no Ribbon UI by default!).

Once this has been achieved we hope to fork the project again and make some modifications to the Win-Nautilus project and add
new features in (if we can get that far! XD).

So if you hate the new Windows 8, Windows Explorer (or just Windows Explorer in general) this is the project for you and I hope
to see some contributers other than me and my friend in the near future.
