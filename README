//This ReadMe is a work in progress!

This is Win-Nautilus, a port of the file manager from the GNOME desktop to Microsoft Windows XP/Vista/7/8.

Project Aims/Goals
==================

This project's primary aim is to port the vanilla Nautilus file manager to Microsoft Windows with native compatibilty
and the means to allow the user to disregard Windows Explorer (or any other file manager) completely.

Other goals include:

1. All the functionality of the original Nautilus

Win-Nautilus aims to all the functionality that has made Nautilus popular as a file manager over the years
and remain consistant with any of GNOME's Nautilus updates.

2. Native Windows interface

Win-Nautilus aims to keep the original Nautilus interface, but with the interface design, GUI widgets
and iconography that the Windows platform provides to make Win-Nautilus look and feel like a native Windows application.

3. Easy installation

Win-Nautilus aims to use a standard .exe/.msi installation wizard allowing it to be installed with ease by anyone from
novices to experts. There will also be tarballs, .zips and instructions to compile from source for those prefer that
method of installation.

4. Easily portable

Win-Nautilus aims not to restrict itself too much to any particular application framework or operating system.
The goal is that Win-Nautilus can easily be ported to almost any other platform (such as Mac OS X) with ease.

5. No OS tie-in

Win-Nautilus aims to be seperate from the operating system it uses and can be installed, unistalled and updated with ease.

Future Goals/Development Roadmap
================================

Once these aims/goals has been achieved we hope to fork the project again and make some modifications to Win-Nautilus
and add these new features in (if we can get that far! XD).

Definite Features:

1. Free and open-source (under the GNU Lesser Public License, donations are always welcome and appreciated!)

2. Native Windows desktop application with the Windows 8 UI and icons (but uses menu bars instead of Ribbon UI by default)

3. Full NTFS file system support as well Linux EXT2/EXT3/EXT4 (planned support for the new ReFS and other file systems)

4. New and intuitive features such as cloud support for Google Drive, Ubuntu One and Dropbox (as well as keeping the majority of the old features that GNOME users love!)

5. A lot of room for user customisation via themes, layout changes...

6. Safely remove your device (memory stick/hard drive) in 1 click (thanks to the "Devices" section of the left pane.)

7 Auto-updater which can grab the latest version and automatically install it for the user.

Design Ideas:

Devices section of the left sidebar has 2 sections - Local and Cloud


Distribution:

Website Download via Ubuntu One - Mirror download link for all implementations except iNautilus.

Windows 8 Marketplace - Download for Nautilus and Nautilus Metro Edition using "Try" as the free version and "Buy" as a donate version.

Website Download via PortableApps.com - Mirror for Nautilus Portable.

Google Play/SlideME - Mirrors for NautilusDroid.apk

BigBoss/ModMyi - Repository used by Cydia for iNautilus.


Possible Reimplementations:

Nautilus Portable - Nautilus which has been portablised and available as a portable application on USB/Hard Drive.

Nautilus Metro Edition - Nautilus as a Metro application with Metro UI for Windows 8, Windows 8 RT and WP7 (proof of concept, mostly).

iNautilus/NautilusDroid - Mobile implementations of Nautilus for jailbroken iOS and Android. (Possibly won't do)

In Closing
==========

So if you hate the new Windows 8, Windows Explorer (or just Windows Explorer in general) this is the project for you and I hope
to see some contributers other than me and my friend in the near future.
